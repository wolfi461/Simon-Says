# Simon Says
This is a final project for my Assembly course. My partner and I created a version of the classic game Simon Says.

The project involved a lot of self-learning, especially for the graphics, sounds, and mouse clicks.

The game has a main menu that looks like that:

where you can choose a difficulty level, read the instructions, start the game, or exit.

If you choose a difficulty level, you'll see the following screen:

easy = 4 turns

normal = 8 turns

hard = 12 turns

extreme! = 16 turns

If you start the game, you'll see this screen:

In the game, you need to click on the squares in the same order they light up. Your score is displayed in the top left corner.

If you lose, you'll see this screen, showing your final score:

If you win, the game will display a message saying you won and play a random victory tune:

Enjoy!
